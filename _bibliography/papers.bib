   abstract = {Scribbles are a popular form of weak annotation for the segmentation of three-dimensional medical images, but typically require iterative refinement to achieve the desired segmentation map. The complexity of diffusion MRI (dMRI) poses additional challenges. Previous work addressed the high dimensionality of dMRI via unsupervised representation learning, and combined it with a random forest classifier that can be re-trained quickly enough to provide interactive feedback to the human annotator. Our work extends that framework in multiple ways. Our main contribution is to add an active learning component that suggests locations in which additional scribbles should be placed. It relies on uncertainty quantification via test time augmentation (TTA). Second, we observe that TTA increases segmentation accuracy even by itself. Moreover, we demonstrate that anomaly detection via isolation forests effectively suppresses false positives that arise when generalizing from sparse scribbles. Taken together, these contributions substantially improve the accuracy that can be achieved with various annotation budgets.},

	 title = {Segmentation {Distortion}: Quantifying {Segmentation} {Uncertainty} {Under} {Domain} {Shift} via the {Effects} of {Anomalous} {Activations}},
   abstract = {Domain shift occurs when training U-Nets for medical image segmentation with images from one device, but applying them to images from a different device. This often reduces accuracy, and it poses a challenge for uncertainty quantification, when incorrect segmentations are produced with high confidence. Recent work proposed to detect such failure cases via anomalies in feature space: Activation patterns that deviate from those observed during training are taken as an indication that the input is not handled well by the network, and its output should not be trusted. However, such latent space distances primarily detect whether images are from different scanners, not whether they are correctly segmented. Therefore, we propose a novel segmentation distortion measure for uncertainty quantification. It uses an autoencoder to make activations more similar to those that were observed during training, and propagates the result through the remainder of the U-Net. We demonstrate that the extent to which this affects the segmentation correlates much more strongly with segmentation errors than distances in activation space, and that it quantifies uncertainty under domain shift better than entropy in the output of a single U-Net, or an ensemble of U-Nets.},

  title     = {Differentiable Segmentation of Sequences},
  abstract  = {Segmented models are widely used to describe non-stationary sequential data with discrete change points. Their estimation usually requires solving a mixed discrete-continuous optimization problem, where the segmentation is the discrete part and all other model parameters are continuous. A number of estimation algorithms have been developed that are highly specialized for their specific model assumptions. The dependence on non-standard algorithms makes it hard to integrate segmented models in state-of-the-art deep learning architectures that critically depend on gradient-based optimization techniques. In this work, we formulate a relaxed variant of segmented models that enables joint estimation of all model parameters, including the segmentation, with gradient descent. We build on recent advances in learning continuous warping functions and propose a novel family of warping functions based on the two-sided power (TSP) distribution. TSP-based warping functions are differentiable, have simple closed-form expressions, and can represent segmentation functions exactly. Our formulation includes the important class of segmented generalized linear models as a special case, which makes it highly versatile. We use our approach to model the spread of COVID-19 with Poisson regression, apply it on a change point detection task, and learn classification models with concept drift. The experiments show that our approach effectively learns all these tasks with standard algorithms for gradient descent.},

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},
  author={Einstein*†, A. and Podolsky*, B. and Rosen*, N.},
  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
